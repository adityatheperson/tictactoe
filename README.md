# tictactoe
I created TicTacToe using python, it does not use any visual libraries it just uses the print command to display the game. It has a bot that trys not to lose to the player. You run the program and start to place peices by inputing the designated number to place a piece there. Then the computer(using very simple AI) comes up with the best move for that senario, but the computer cannot plan ahead. It does not have a stratagy. So if the player cannot win or the computer cannot win on the next move it will place a piece on a random spot.
